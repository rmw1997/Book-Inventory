# Book Inventory

## Overview

This application is a ***books inventory*** implemented using a ***stack*** concept. The books are pushed based on five specific attributes, which are: book title, author, ISBN number, book price and book genre.

## Methods Used

- `push()`: to insert a new book in the inventory.
- `pop()`: to delete the top book from the inventory.
- `printAll()`: to print all the books information in the inventory.
- `find()`: to check if the book is available in the inventory or not.
- `print()`: to retrieve/print a collection of books based on their genre.

The application allows the user to view the books inventory by choosing the desired style, either view all the books or by determining the genre of the books. If the user chooses “By genre” style, he should enter the number of the genre to display the available books in that category.
